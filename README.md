### Purpose
Personality Analyzer:

1. Uses the Traitify API. Specifically, for this personal project, it uses the 'Persuasion' test.
2. Uses an arbitrary 'algorithm' that uses the results for the 6 traits measured by Traitify.
3. Using those result values, we make a sole score out of 100.
4. Score is meant to be a percent of 'hiring potential' through sheer personality
* For this passion project, it was supposed to be for tech startups as regular employees
* Has very light psychological basis, 
* Sole assessment score has no scientific basis.
